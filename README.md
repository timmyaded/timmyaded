# 👋 Hi, I'm Timilehin!

I'm a 23-year-old web developer from Nigeria, currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've been building projects for about 6 months and I'm really passionate about growing my skills and exploring backend development soon.

## 🛠 What I'm Working On
- Making cool and responsive websites
- Learning more about JavaScript and DOM manipulation
- Experimenting with small games and interactive apps

## ⚽ When I'm not coding...
I enjoy gaming, playing football, and just unwinding.

⭐️ Fun fact: I'm always trying to learn one new thing each week — whether it's a CSS trick or a Git command!
