# 👋 Hey there, I'm Timilehin

I'm a young Nigerian learning web development. I've been at it for over a year now — mostly focused on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building fun little projects as I learn, like simple games and responsive websites.

## 💻 What I'm Up To

- Learning the ins and outs of JavaScript  
- Building projects to sharpen my frontend skills  
- Planning to explore backend stuff soon  
- Trying to make my code look cleaner and more responsive
- Looking to collaborate and create exciting projects

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate

I'm down to connect with other devs, especially if you're also learning or just enjoy making cool stuff. If you're working on something interesting or want to team up, feel free to reach out!

## 🎮 Outside of Code

When I’m not coding, I’m probably playing football, gaming, or just relaxing. I like keeping things fun and learning at my own pace — no pressure, just progress.

Thanks for checking out my profile! 😄
